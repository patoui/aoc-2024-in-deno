# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 in Deno

My attempts at [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) using [Deno](https://deno.com/)

## 📋 Instructions

To run any day and part, simply run the following command (change the day and part as needed)

```bash
deno run -A day_1/part_1.ts
```

### 🧪 Running tests

Similar to running the solution, but switch out `run` for `test` and add the `_test` suffix to the file name, example:

```bash
deno test -A day_1/part_2_test.ts
```
